# 🧩 Bell State Demonstration with Qiskit

This repository contains a **fully documented Jupyter Notebook** that demonstrates how to create and measure a **Bell state** using Qiskit.  
A Bell state is a maximally entangled two-qubit state — fundamental in quantum computing, quantum communication, and quantum teleportation.
